<ManSection>
<Func Name="Download" Arg="url[, opt]" />

<Description>
This function downloads the file with the web address <A>url</A>,
which must be a string.
<P/>
The result is a record which has at least the component <C>success</C>,
with value <K>true</K> if the download was successful and <K>false</K>
otherwise.
In the former case, the component <C>result</C> is bound,
whose value is a string that contains the contents of the downloaded file.
In the latter case, the component <C>error</C> is bound,
whose value is a string that describes the problem.
<P/>
The function calls the methods stored in the global list
<C>Download_Methods</C> until one of them is successful.
Currently there are methods based on the &GAP; functions
<Ref Func="DownloadURL" BookName="curl"/> and
<Ref Func="SingleHTTPRequest" BookName="io"/>,
and methods based on the external programs <C>wget</C> and <C>curl</C>.
<P/>
An optional record <A>opt</A> can be given.
The following components are supported.
<P/>
<List>
<Mark><C>target</C></Mark>
<Item>
  If this component is bound then its value must be a string
  that is a local filename,
  and the function writes the downloaded contents to this file;
  the returned record does not have a <C>result</C> component in this case.
</Item>
<Mark><C>verifyCert</C></Mark>
<Item>
  If this component is bound and has the value <K>false</K>
  then those download methods that are based on <C>curl</C> or <C>wget</C>
  will omit the check of the server's certificate.

  The same effect is achieved for all <Ref Func="Download"/> calls
  by setting the user preference <C>DownloadVerifyCertificate</C>
  (see <Ref Subsect="subsec-DownloadVerifyCertificate"/>) to <K>false</K>
  and omitting the <C>verifyCert</C> component from <A>opt</A>.
</Item>
</List>

<Heading>User preference <C>DownloadVerifyCertificate</C></Heading>
<Index Key="DownloadVerifyCertificate"><C>DownloadVerifyCertificate</C></Index>

The value <K>true</K> (the default) means that the server's certificate
is checked in calls of <Ref Func="Download"/>,
such that nothing gets downloaded if the certificate is invalid.

If the value is <K>false</K> then those download methods that are based on
<C>curl</C> or <C>wget</C> will omit the check of the server's certificate.

One can set the value of the preference to <C>val</C> via
<Ref Func="SetUserPreference" BookName="ref"/>, by calling
<C>SetUserPreference( "utils", "DownloadVerifyCertificate", val )</C>,
and access the current value via 
<Ref Func="UserPreference" BookName="ref"/>, by calling
<C>UserPreference( "utils", "DownloadVerifyCertificate" )</C>.
